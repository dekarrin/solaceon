Solaceon

Abandoned Flash life simulator

Solaceon was my first attempt at a large-scale programming project. It was intended to be a simulation of biology and geology, and it was very much inspired by Maxis' classic game, SimLife. The project died once the scale of what I was trying to do outgrew my abilities.

The game was built in Flash using ActionScript 2. All of the Flash assets were lost except for the source code; unless those assets are replaced, this game will never run.

At the time of the initial source code commit, the files were last edited on the 17th of July, 2009.
